# Business Insights 360 — Power BI Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  

AtliQ Hardware has grown rapidly in recent years and decided to adopt **Power BI analytics** for the first time to stay competitive and enable data-driven decision-making across the organization.  

This project was built as part of the **Codebasics Business Insights 360 Power BI Course** and delivers insights across **Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain** through an integrated analytics dashboard.  

The objective was to convert scattered business data into a structured decision-support system that helps stakeholders understand performance, diagnose issues, and take informed actions.

## 🏢 Company Background — AtliQ Hardware  

AtliQ Hardware is a global consumer electronics company that sells computers and accessories through three primary channels:  

- **Retailers** (Brick & Mortar stores)  
- **Direct** (Company-to-customer sales)  
- **Distributors**  

The company previously expanded into Latin America based on surveys, intuition, and basic Excel analysis — which resulted in significant financial losses. At the same time, competitors such as Dell were already leveraging advanced analytics to guide strategy and operations.  

To avoid repeating past mistakes and remain competitive, AtliQ Hardware initiated this Power BI analytics project to institutionalize data-driven decision-making.
